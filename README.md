 MY FACTORIAL CALCULATOR  is a calculator that gets you the answers to various mathematical calculation that involves factorials like factorial,permutation,combination,pascal triangle(for getting the coeficients in binomial theory etc).
 The version 2 is just the simplified edition to version 1
 Although, there will always be an upgrade to it as time goes on.
 Thanks

                        FACTORIAL
        The factorial of a number n written as n! is
                        n! = n * (n-1) * ... * 1
    For example:
        the factorial of 5 = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
                            = 120

                        PERMUTATION AND COMBINATION
        Permutation is the total number of ways a subset(can be words etc) can be derived from a set(of letters of a word) while combination is the total number of ways a subset can be derived from a word without repeating...
                        SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF BOTH PERMUTATION AND COMBINATION
    PERMUTATION OF FIOTY IN TWO'S                                   
        fi,fo,ft,fy,
        if,it,iy,io                   let n =   Number of letters in FIOTY = 5
        of,oi,ot,oy                  let r =     Number of pair = 2
        tf,ti,to,ty,                      Total number of arrangement = 20 ways
        yf,yi,yo,yt

    COMBINATION OF FIOTY IN TWO'S
        fo,ft,fy,if,it,                     Total number of arrangement = 10 ways
        oi,oy,to,ty,yi

This is because there are repeatitions in permutation like fo and of etc...

therefore,
                    Permutation of n with r = n!/(n-r)!
       ALSO,        Combination of n with r = n!/n!(n-r)!

       WHERE n = number of objects to choose from
             r = number of objects used 


                        PASCAL TRIANGLE
        These are basically the coefficients of any binomial expansion
